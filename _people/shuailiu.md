## Research Interests

- New Theories in Statistical Machine Learning

- Deep Learning Networks and Inference

- Artificial Intelligence Security

- Deep Reinforcement Learning

- Software Design

Leveraging the aforementioned theories and methodologies, we focus on applications such as blind noise reduction, classification, object detection/tracking, adversarial machine learning, AI-generated content (AIGC) defense, large model security, AI testing, autonomous driving (including tracking, prediction, and decision-making), power grid system modeling and optimization, landing/ship-based operations, and the development of domestic hardware and customized software.
