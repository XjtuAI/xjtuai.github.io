XJTU AI Research is dedicated to researching cutting-edge AI technologies. We firmly believe that the value of technology lies in its ability to enhance productivity, rather than solely in being published in high-impact journals or conferencesâ€”at least, this should not be the only criterion for evaluation. Our focus areas include

- [Medical AI](https://xjtuai.com/histogym/)
- Green AI 
- Material AI
- Art AI
- Large Language Models
- Embodied Intelligence 
- Swarm Intelligence
- Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
  <br> 
  <br>
  Our goal is to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence and develop innovative solutions that address complex challenges across various domains.

            Is the diagnostic process of doctors better modeled as a decision-making task rather than a classification task? To address this question, we propose HistoGym, a custom gym environment for Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis.
